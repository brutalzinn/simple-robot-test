# SIMPLE ROBOT


## This robot is for entertainment purpose

## This example is created by http://arduino-skeleton-generator.boberto.net:3000/

## How this works?

1. The ESP 01 will accept incoming socket hand shakes acting like a slave.
2. The ESP 01 will send the received json to the arduino by serial communication.
3. The arduino will start the robot movements.

## Diagram 

Sooner or later will be here.

## Why are you describing with multiple models name?

This is because everytime i change the hardware, i will update the model version too.

This estructure was developed because i need to use Python with OpenCV to process models o cats. Detect my cat and try to distract him
